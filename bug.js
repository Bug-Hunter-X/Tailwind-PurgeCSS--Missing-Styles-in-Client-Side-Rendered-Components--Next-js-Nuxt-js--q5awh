This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js that uses server-side rendering (SSR).  The issue arises because Tailwind's purge functionality may not correctly identify all the classes used in your application's components that are rendered on the client-side, after the server-side rendering has already completed. This results in these classes being removed from the final CSS output, leading to unexpected styling issues or missing styles in the client-side rendered components. This typically happens with dynamically generated components where the classes are not available to the purge process during the build process.
